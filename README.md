# holy-notes
 A Powercord plugin that lets you note messages.

Note: This Plugin is WIP and will most likely never be fully finished

### Some quick notes:
The Note Viewer itself looks like dogwater, the functionality however should be fine


To Delete Notes use the Powercord command 
``` [prefix]Notebook erase [Message ID]```

To get the Link to a Note use the Powercord command
``` [prefix]Notebook link [Message ID]```

The Message ID is listed above the Message in Note Viewer.
